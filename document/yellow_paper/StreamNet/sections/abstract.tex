%TRIAS StreamNet is a DAG (Directed Asyclyc Graph) blockchain design rooted from the existing mature systems. 
Considering major issues in the existing DAG systems such as centralization caused by the introduction of Coordinator, double-spending and sybil attacks, slow transaction speed etc. 
We designed and implemented the StreamNet system which is forked from the IOTA implementation.
By leveraging the Topological sorting and Katz centrality computation, we infer a pivotal chain along the path of each topological level in the graph,
and each block in the pivotal chain will have the highest Katz centrality score, which could be used as the entry point for the tip selection algorithm.
In addtion, with comprehensive integration of information such as transaction (vertices), 
transaction approval information (edges), and network structure (such as community structure) we designed the tip selection algorithm that obeys the local modifier method and can detect and avoid double spend / sybil attacks.
